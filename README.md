### BasefinderModule Usage

**BasefinderModule** is a Minecraft mod for scanning chunks in a spiral pattern to locate storage containers.

#### **How to Use:**
- **Activate:** Enable the module via keybind or GUI.
- **Set Start Position:** Use the command `*basefinderstart <x>,<z>` to set a custom start position, or it defaults to your current position.
- **Automatic Search:** The module spirals through chunks, checking for storage containers.
- **Notifications:** Alerts you when a chunk is reached or when the storage container threshold is met.
- **Save Progress:** The current step is saved on disable (if enabled) for future continuation.

This tool is ideal for finding hidden bases or storages on multiplayer servers.
